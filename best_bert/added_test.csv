1,Enquiry,"We have received the following questions from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. We will not necessarily respond but would you please provide answers and let me know your view whether or not we should respond to the following:

Have you had any further contact from Fitch? 

Has there been a change in status to the SEC inquiry? Which office is handling Fort Worth?

Have you been contacted by the Federal Reserve or any other agency conducting an investigation?

Have you been in contact with or retained bankruptcy counsel?

Have you been contacted about a takeover Royal Dutch/GE?

Have you retained Goldman Sachs to advise you on credit rating/financing issues or to find a strategic partner? Will they receive an equity stake to help Enron get out of its current situation?


These reporters are on deadline tonight so let me know as soon as possible.

Thank you."
2,Enquiry,"Jeff,

As always your proposal is creative. After reviewing your presentation, 
here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:

1. Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
replaces? If not, how do we justify a different standard?

2. Can we credibly say that the California economy and reliability will be
served by shifting energy supply from California to a broader Western
market?

3. Will FERC be convinced by the arguments on competitive issues, or will
it view this as something that further concentrates market power?

4. Do we need outright acquisition rather than contracts?

5. Can we structure a creative way to allow the QFs to participate in the
upside over the long term (i.e. the higher priced years)?

6. How would we be assured that SCE would use any funds from this to pay
QFs and keep them running?

I look forward to discussing these tomorrow.

Mike"
3,Enquiry,"In preparation for Friday's bank conference, Cheryl Lipshutz and I are sitting with the banks right now and we understand that you are meeting with them at 2pm this afternoon. Here is a list of the initial questions they are posing to the RAC group:

RAC
1.	Does VAR analyses take care of the quality of the assets?
2.	What is the correlation matrix?  How often is it updated and validated?
3.	Can you discuss reserve methodology?
4.	Can the banks get more detail of Enron's current asset/position breakdown?

Credit
1.	Bank debts on the balance sheet?

These are the issues right now. If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
James"
4,Enquiry,"Our analysis shows a 35% increase in shipping costs for international orders. Has the logistics team evaluated alternative carriers for these routes? The current delivery timeframes have increased by an average of 7 days, which is causing customer satisfaction issues in our European markets.

The cost differential between domestic and international shipping has grown from 2.8x to 4.3x in just one quarter. Is this a temporary spike related to fuel costs, or are there structural issues with our distribution network that need to be addressed?

Can you provide a breakdown of which product categories are most affected by these increases? We need to determine whether selective price adjustments might be necessary.

Thank you for looking into this."
5,Enquiry,"Our customer satisfaction metrics have declined 15% since implementing the new billing system last quarter. Has the customer service team identified specific functionality issues that might be causing this drop? I've received numerous Complaints about invoice errors and delayed response times from our key accounts.

The data shows that call resolution times have increased from an average of 8 minutes to nearly 17 minutes, while first-call resolution has dropped from 76% to 52%. 

Has IT conducted any post-implementation review to address these concerns? Are there plans to revert to the previous system if these issues can't be resolved quickly?

Our quarterly business review is coming up, and I need to provide the executive team with specific remediation actions. Can you share the current troubleshooting plan and timeline?"
6,Enquiry,"The operational performance metrics for the Western region show a 23% increase in delivery failures compared to last quarter. Has the logistics team identified the root causes for these failures? Our initial analysis suggests problems with both the scheduling system and third-party carriers.

Is this a temporary situation related to the recent software upgrade, or have there been personnel changes that might be affecting performance? The customer impact is becoming significant, with several key accounts threatening to reduce their orders.

What corrective actions have been implemented, and when can we expect to see improvements? Do we need to allocate additional resources to this region while the issues are being resolved?

Please provide an update by Thursday so I can address these concerns in the divisional meeting."
7,Enquiry,"The Alpha Project is showing a 30% schedule variance according to last week's status report. Has the project team identified specific bottlenecks causing these delays? The original timeline projected completion by March, but current projections indicate a potential slip to May or June.

Have the required resources been fully allocated to the critical path activities? Our stakeholder analysis suggests that several key deliverables are dependent on technical resources that appear overcommitted.

What mitigation strategies are being considered? Would adding external consultants help accelerate the timeline, or are there fundamental scope issues that need to be addressed?

I need to update the steering committee next week, so a comprehensive status update would be appreciated."
8,Enquiry,"Dear Jeffrey:

Will you be able to join other VentureWire subscribers
in the Bay Area for this month's breakfast briefing?

We'll be gathering at the San Mateo Marriott on
Wednesday, September 19 to hear Mark Klopp's thoughts
on this month's topic:

When Corporate and Venture Worlds Collide: Aligning
Strategic and Financial Goals in Corporate Venturing

What approach to corporate venturing is most beneficial
for startups?

Can startups compete for talent with corporate-funded
rivals?

Why are some corporations abandoning their venture
programs?

Is your startup a candidate for corporate venture
funding?

Join us on Wednesday at 8 a.m. for this important discussion.
Space is limited to 40 guests.

Please reserve your space by return e-mail."
9,Enquiry,"Order processing times have increased 25% since implementing the new workflow system last month. Has the operations team identified specific bottlenecks in the process? Customer Complaints about late deliveries have increased dramatically, and our on-time delivery metric has dropped from 94% to 81%.

According to our system logs, the order validation step now takes three times longer than before, and we're seeing a 40% increase in exception handling. Have any configuration changes been made that might explain these issues?

What steps can we take immediately to improve performance while a more permanent solution is developed? Would reverting to the previous workflow make sense, or are there quick fixes we can implement?

I need recommendations by Friday so we can discuss them in the operations review meeting."
10,Enquiry,"Customer feedback shows growing confusion about our new pricing model. Has the marketing team tested alternative ways to present this information? Our conversion rate has dropped 18% since the rollout, and customer service reports that 32% of all calls now relate to pricing questions.

The web analytics show that visitors are spending three times longer on the pricing page but are 45% less likely to proceed to the purchase flow. Is the complexity of the tiered structure causing decision paralysis?

Have we considered running focus groups to better understand customer pain points? Should we simplify the pricing structure, even if it means potentially lower revenue for some customer segments?

Please share your thoughts on how we can address this growing concern."
11,Enquiry,"Help desk tickets for password resets have increased 45% since the new security policy implementation. Is it possible to simplify the authentication requirements without compromising security? The average employee now spends approximately 7.5 minutes per week just managing passwords.

The data shows that 23% of all support calls are now password-related, up from just 8% last quarter. Is this just an adoption curve issue that will improve over time, or have we made the requirements too complex for regular users?

Could we implement single sign-on for more systems to reduce the burden? Are there other companies in our industry that have found a better balance between security and usability?

I'd appreciate your thoughts on how we might improve this situation while maintaining our security posture."
12,Enquiry,"Has there been any further progress on the negotiations with the third-party supplier for the Eastern region? Our inventory forecasts show we'll reach critical levels in roughly 45 days if the new agreement isn't finalized. The pricing differential between the current and proposed supplier represents approximately $1.2M in annual savings.

Have we evaluated contingency options if this deal falls through? What alternative suppliers could meet our volume requirements with minimal quality compromises?

Could we temporarily shift some production to our internal facilities to reduce dependence on this supplier? What would be the cost implications of such a move?

I need to update the procurement committee next week, so any information you can provide would be helpful."
13,Enquiry,"The collateral optimization model is showing a 14% increase in required margin deposits despite relatively stable positions. Initial analysis suggests changes in correlation assumptions might be responsible, but documentation is unclear. Has the quantitative team modified the diversification benefit calculations in the latest release? We need to understand these changes to properly manage funding requirements across trading desks.

The model previously applied a correlation factor of 0.65 for related energy commodities, but it appears this may have been reduced to 0.4 in the current version. What market data supports this change?

Could you arrange a meeting with the risk modeling team to walk through the recent modifications? This funding impact is significant enough to affect our liquidity forecasts for the quarter."
14,Enquiry,"Our analysis shows an unexpected increase in customer support contacts specifically related to account access issues. Ticket volume has increased by 68% for password resets and security verification processes without corresponding changes to our authentication systems. Has the IT security team implemented any new validation rules or lockout thresholds? Understanding these technical constraints is essential for balancing security requirements with user experience considerations.

The data indicates that 73% of these incidents occur during the first login attempt after the weekend. Is there a session timeout parameter that needs adjustment?

Has there been any recent security patch that might be affecting the authentication flow? We need to address this quickly as it's creating significant frustration among our highest-value customers."
15,Enquiry,"Supply chain delays affecting European component deliveries. Lead times increased from 23 to 38 days without vendor communication. Has procurement identified regional logistics constraints? Understanding these factors critical for production scheduling.

Our analysis shows most delays originating at Rotterdam port, with container processing times doubled since last quarter. Is this related to the new customs procedures, or are there capacity issues with our freight forwarder?

The delays have already impacted three production runs, with potential revenue impact of approximately €1.2M if not resolved within two weeks. Have we considered air freight alternatives for critical components?

Could you provide a detailed breakdown of which SKUs are most affected so we can prioritize our response?"
16,Enquiry,"Customer service satisfaction scores have declined 14 points since implementing the new phone system. Has the support team identified specific functionality issues affecting call quality? Survey responses indicate that 42% of customers report having to repeat information multiple times during transfers.

The average handle time has increased by 3.2 minutes per call, and abandonment rates have risen from 6% to 17%. Is this primarily a training issue for the staff, or are there technical limitations in the system that need to be addressed?

Have we considered rolling back to the previous system until these issues are resolved? What is the projected timeline for fixing the most critical problems?

I'd appreciate a comprehensive analysis of the situation and proposed remediation steps by the end of the week."
17,Enquiry,"We've noticed a 27% increase in raw material costs for our primary product line this quarter. Has the procurement team identified alternative suppliers or substitute materials? Margin analysis indicates we'll need to increase prices by 8-12% to maintain profitability if these costs persist.

The futures market suggests these increases may not be temporary. Have we secured any longer-term contracts to hedge against continued inflation? What price sensitivity models have been run to determine the potential impact on demand?

Should we consider reformulating certain products to reduce dependency on the most volatile materials? What would be the R&D timeline for such changes?

Please provide an assessment of our options before the quarterly planning meeting next week."
18,Enquiry,"The new marketing automation platform implementation is showing concerning adoption rates. Only 32% of the marketing team is regularly using the system after three weeks, compared to our target of 75%. Has the training team identified specific features that users are struggling with?

Our analysis shows that campaign creation times have actually increased by 47% compared to the old system. Is this a temporary learning curve issue, or are there workflow inefficiencies that need to be addressed?

Has the vendor provided any benchmark data on typical adoption rates and time-to-proficiency? Are there configuration changes that could simplify the most common tasks?

What additional resources would be needed to accelerate adoption and realize the projected efficiency gains by next quarter?"
19,Enquiry,"We've observed a significant discrepancy between forecasted and actual energy consumption at our Chicago facility. October usage was 28% above projections, resulting in approximately $45,000 in unanticipated costs. Has the facilities team identified specific equipment or operational changes that might explain this variance?

The HVAC system runtime logs show increased activity despite moderate weather conditions. Have there been thermostat setting changes or calibration issues that could account for this?

Our analysis indicates the consumption pattern changed abruptly in the third week of September. Was any new equipment installed or were operating hours extended around this time?

Could you arrange a comprehensive energy audit to identify potential inefficiencies? This trend, if continued, would significantly impact our annual operating budget."
20,Enquiry,"The revenue recognition algorithm has flagged an unusual pattern in the Western region's transactions. Contract values appear to have increased by an average of 22% while actual delivery quantities have remained relatively flat. Has the sales team modified their pricing strategy, or could this indicate potential revenue recognition issues?

Our analysis shows that most of this variance is concentrated in multi-year agreements, where first-year values have increased significantly while total contract values remain consistent with historical patterns. Is this a deliberate shift in how we're structuring these deals?

Have we received any feedback from the auditors on this approach? Are there compliance considerations we should be addressing before the quarterly financial close?

I'd appreciate your insights on this matter as soon as possible."
21,Enquiry,"Customer acquisition costs have increased 38% over the past quarter while conversion rates have declined by 12%. Has the marketing analytics team identified specific channels or campaigns driving this negative trend? Our dashboard shows particularly poor performance from paid search, where cost per click has nearly doubled.

The competitive analysis indicates several new entrants aggressively bidding on our core keywords. Have we evaluated alternative targeting strategies that might be more cost-effective in this environment?

What attribution model adjustments might give us better insight into which touchpoints are truly driving conversions? Our current last-click model may be undervaluing certain top-of-funnel activities.

Could you prepare a revised channel strategy for review that addresses these concerns? We need to reverse this trend before it significantly impacts our unit economics."
22,Enquiry,"The quarterly compliance audit has flagged a 35% increase in documentation exceptions for the Western region. Has the regional management team identified process changes or staffing issues that might be contributing to this trend? Our preliminary analysis shows most exceptions related to incomplete customer verification steps.

Is this primarily a training issue, or are there system limitations making it difficult for representatives to complete all required fields? The pattern suggests particular difficulties with the new regulatory requirements implemented last quarter.

Have similar issues been observed in other regions using the same processes and systems? What best practices from better-performing areas might be transferable?

Please provide an assessment of the situation and proposed remediation plan by Monday, as we'll need to discuss this with the compliance committee next week."
23,Enquiry,"Our analysis of the project portfolio shows that 42% of initiatives are currently behind schedule, up from 28% last quarter. Has the PMO identified common factors contributing to these delays? Resource constraints appear to be a recurring theme in the status reports, particularly for technical specialists.

The data suggests that initial estimates are increasingly unreliable, with actual delivery times averaging 1.7x the projected timelines. Are we applying consistent estimation methodologies across teams, or is each group using their own approach?

Have we considered implementing a more rigorous stage-gate process to catch potential issues earlier? What additional tools or metrics might give us better visibility into developing problems?

I'd appreciate your thoughts on how we might improve our project delivery performance in the coming quarter."
24,Enquiry,"The employee engagement survey results for Q3 show a 17-point decline in satisfaction with management communication. Has the executive team analyzed specific feedback themes that might explain this drop? The most significant decreases were in transparency about company direction and feeling informed about changes affecting teams.

Department-level analysis shows particular concerns in Product Development and Customer Operations, where scores have fallen below the 25th percentile benchmark. Have recent reorganizations or leadership changes in these areas been effectively communicated?

What communication strategy adjustments are being considered to address these concerns? Are there successful approaches from higher-scoring departments that could be adopted more broadly?

I'd welcome your perspective on this issue before the all-hands meeting next week."
25,Enquiry,"The annual security assessment identified a 42% increase in vulnerable endpoints compared to last year's review. Has the IT team determined whether this is due to growth in our environment or deterioration in our security posture? The report specifically highlights unpatched systems and non-compliant configurations as primary concerns.

Our analysis indicates that approximately 65% of these vulnerabilities exist in departmental systems outside central IT management. Have we considered expanding the scope of our unified endpoint management solution to include these assets?

What additional resources would be required to address the highest-risk items within the next 30 days? Are there automated remediation tools that could accelerate this process?

Please provide a prioritized remediation plan with timeline and resource requirements by the end of the week."
26,Enquiry,"The sales pipeline analysis shows a concerning 28% decrease in qualified opportunities for the enterprise segment this quarter. Has the sales leadership team identified market factors or competitive changes that might explain this trend? Our win rate has remained relatively stable, suggesting the issue lies in top-of-funnel activities.

The data indicates that lead-to-opportunity conversion has fallen most dramatically for financial services and healthcare verticals. Have there been regulatory changes or industry-specific concerns affecting these sectors?

What adjustments to our marketing messaging or sales approach are being considered? Should we revisit our ideal customer profile given these changing dynamics?

I'd appreciate your assessment of the situation and recommended actions before the quarterly sales planning session next week."
27,Enquiry,"Our analysis of the new product launch shows adoption rates 43% below projections after the first month. Has the product team identified specific features or positioning elements that might be missing customer expectations? The usage data indicates most users abandon the onboarding process at the integration step.

Customer interviews suggest that the implementation requirements may be more complex than we communicated. Have we adequately resourced the customer success team to support users through this process?

Is the current pricing structure aligned with the perceived value, especially given the implementation effort required? What quick wins could we implement to improve the user experience while more substantial changes are developed?

Please provide your assessment of the situation and recommended next steps by Monday so we can discuss them in the product review meeting."
28,Enquiry,"The latest market intelligence report indicates our main competitor has reduced prices by 15-20% in the enterprise segment. Has the competitive analysis team evaluated how this will impact our win rates and deal sizes? Our current models suggest we could lose up to 25% market share in this segment if we don't respond.

The timing coincides with their recent funding round, suggesting this may be a sustained strategy rather than a temporary promotion. Have we modeled various response scenarios and their impact on our unit economics?

What non-pricing differentiators could we emphasize more strongly to justify our premium? Are there bundle opportunities that might provide more value while preserving margins?

I'd appreciate your thoughts on our optimal response strategy before the executive committee meeting on Thursday."
29,Enquiry,"We've observed a 34% increase in infrastructure costs despite relatively stable usage patterns. Has the cloud operations team identified potential inefficiencies or architectural issues driving this trend? Our analysis shows particular growth in data transfer and storage costs.

The usage patterns suggest we may not be effectively utilizing reserved instances or taking advantage of cost optimization features. Have we conducted a thorough review of our infrastructure configuration against current best practices?

What automated cost management tools have we evaluated? Several of our industry peers have reported significant savings through implementation of these solutions.

Could you prepare a cost optimization roadmap with projected savings and implementation timelines for review at next week's technology steering committee?"
30,Enquiry,"The monthly risk dashboard shows a significant increase in policy exceptions for the European division, with violations up 47% compared to baseline. Has the compliance team identified specific regulatory changes or process modifications that might explain this trend? The majority of exceptions relate to documentation completeness and verification timeliness.

Regional management suggests that recent system changes have created workflow inefficiencies, requiring staff to use manual workarounds. Have we evaluated the impact of these changes on productivity and compliance?

What immediate steps can be taken to address the highest-risk exceptions? Are there opportunities to streamline processes while maintaining regulatory compliance?

Please provide a comprehensive assessment and remediation plan by Friday, as we'll need to report on this situation to the audit committee next week."
31,Enquiry,"Our analysis of the new marketing campaign shows conversion rates 32% below forecast, despite traffic metrics meeting expectations. Has the digital team identified elements of the landing page or checkout process that might be creating friction? Heatmap data suggests users are getting confused at the product selection step.

A/B testing on the call-to-action messaging shows the original version outperforming the new copy by a significant margin. Have we considered reverting this element while maintaining the updated visual design?

Mobile conversion rates appear particularly affected, with a 54% drop compared to desktop. Are there responsive design issues that need urgent attention?

Please provide an assessment of the critical issues and proposed solutions so we can implement changes before the campaign budget is further depleted."
32,Enquiry,"The quarterly business review indicates customer churn has increased from 4.7% to 7.2% over the past three months. Has the customer success team identified common reasons cited in exit interviews? Our preliminary analysis shows particular vulnerability among customers in the 7-12 month lifecycle stage.

Usage data for churned accounts shows a 38% decline in platform engagement in the weeks preceding cancellation. Are there early warning indicators we could monitor more proactively?

The financial impact of this trend represents approximately $2.8M in annual recurring revenue. What retention initiatives have been evaluated, and what resources would be required to implement them?

I'd appreciate your assessment and recommendations before the executive planning session next week."
33,Enquiry,"Our analysis shows that the development team's velocity has decreased by 31% over the last three sprints. Has the engineering management identified specific impediments causing this slowdown? The quality metrics remain stable, suggesting this isn't due to increased focus on technical debt.

The data indicates a growing backlog of blocked items, primarily waiting on dependencies from the infrastructure team. Is this related to the recent reorganization, or are there resource constraints affecting cross-team collaboration?

Have we considered adjusting our sprint planning process to better account for these dependencies? What process changes might improve our ability to deliver predictably?

Please provide your assessment and recommendations for addressing this trend before it impacts our quarterly delivery commitments."
34,Enquiry,"The monthly security report shows a 78% increase in attempted breaches targeting our customer data environment. Has the security team identified any patterns that might indicate a coordinated attack rather than random probing? The logs show particular focus on our API endpoints and authentication systems.

Our analysis indicates that approximately 23% of these attempts use credentials that appear valid but fail secondary verification steps. Is there evidence of a potential data breach from a third-party source exposing customer information?

What immediate steps are being taken to strengthen our security posture? Are there additional monitoring or protection measures that should be implemented on an emergency basis?

Please provide a comprehensive assessment of the situation and recommendations for both immediate and longer-term security enhancements."
35,Enquiry,"We're seeing a concerning trend in our quality metrics, with defect rates up 28% in the last quarter. Has the manufacturing team identified process changes or supplier issues that might explain this increase? The data shows particular problems with the electronic components from our Singapore facility.

The pattern suggests issues with a specific batch of materials received in August. Have we conducted a thorough analysis of incoming quality checks and whether procedures were followed correctly?

What immediate corrective actions have been implemented, and how are we preventing potentially defective units from reaching customers? Have we quantified the financial impact of rework and potential returns?

Please provide a detailed assessment and remediation plan before the weekly operations review meeting."
36,Enquiry,"The latest market research indicates our brand awareness has dropped 12 percentage points among our core demographic over the past six months. Has the marketing team identified specific factors contributing to this decline? Our share of voice analysis shows competitors have increased their media spend significantly during this period.

Customer survey data suggests confusion about our value proposition following the recent product line expansion. Are we effectively communicating how our various offerings relate to each other and the core brand promise?

What adjustments to our marketing strategy are being considered to address this trend? Are there opportunities to consolidate our messaging for greater impact with the same budget?

I'd appreciate your assessment and recommendations before the brand strategy session next month."
37,Enquiry,"The data center migration project is currently showing a 45% schedule variance, with completion now projected for August rather than May. Has the infrastructure team identified specific challenges causing these delays? The status reports mention unexpected complexity in the legacy systems, but lack specific details.

Our analysis indicates that the testing phase is taking substantially longer than planned, with migration validation requiring approximately twice the estimated effort. Have we underestimated the complexity of our environment, or are there process inefficiencies that could be addressed?

What mitigation strategies are being considered to accelerate the timeline? Would additional resources help, or are there fundamental technical challenges that need to be resolved?

Please provide a detailed assessment and revised project plan by Friday."
38,Enquiry,"The vendor evaluation committee has identified three finalists for the new CRM system, but our analysis shows significant variation in their TCO calculations. Has the IT team developed a standardized model that accounts for all implementation, licensing, and operational costs? Initial estimates range from $1.2M to $2.8M over five years.

The feature comparison indicates that Vendor B lacks native integration with our marketing automation platform, which could require additional development work. Have these costs been fully factored into the TCO model?

Our customer service team has expressed concerns about the user interface of Vendor C, suggesting potential training and adoption challenges. Have we conducted sufficient hands-on testing with actual users to validate these concerns?

What additional evaluation steps would you recommend before making a final decision?"
39,Enquiry,"We've observed unusual trading patterns in the natural gas futures market over the past week, with volatility 62% higher than seasonal norms. Has the risk management team analyzed potential factors driving these fluctuations? Weather forecasts don't appear to explain the magnitude of these moves.

Our position analysis shows potential exposure of approximately $8.2M if these conditions persist. Have we considered adjusting our hedging strategy to mitigate this risk?

The pattern somewhat resembles the market disruption we saw in 2018, which was later attributed to a large player unwinding positions. Are there indicators of similar institutional activity in the current market?

Please provide your assessment of the situation and any recommended changes to our trading strategy or risk limits."
40,Enquiry,"Our analysis of the new compensation structure shows concerning trends in the sales organization, with top performer retention down 18% since implementation. Has HR identified specific elements of the plan that might be driving this attrition? The data suggests particular dissatisfaction with the extended vesting schedule and higher quota thresholds.

Competitor intelligence indicates several firms are specifically targeting our sales talent with accelerated vesting and guaranteed first-year compensation packages. Have we conducted a thorough market comparison to ensure our total compensation remains competitive?

What short-term adjustments could be made to address retention concerns while a more comprehensive review is conducted? Are there non-monetary incentives that might help bridge the gap?

Please provide your assessment and recommendations before the executive compensation committee meeting next week."
